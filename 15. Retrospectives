In Agile development, a retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each iteration to discuss what was successful, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the improvements and retain the successes in future iterations. Regularly conducted retrospective meetings, when appropriate follow up activities occur, are critical to self-organization, and continual improvement of development, and testing.

Testers are part of the team, and bring their unique perspective. Testing occurs in each sprint, and vitally contributes to success. All team members, testers, and non-testers, can provide input on both testing, and non-testing activities.
