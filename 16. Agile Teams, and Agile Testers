Whole Team

The whole-team approach means involving everyone with the knowledge, and skills necessary toe nsure project success. The team includes representatives from the customer, and other business stakeholders who determine product features. The team should be relatively small; successful teams have been observed with as few as three people, and as many as nine. Ideally, the whole team shares the same workspace, as co-location strongly facilitates communication, and interaction. The whole-team approach is supported through the daily stand-up meetings involving all members of the team, where work progress is communicated, and any impediments to progress are highlighted.

The Power of Three

The concept of involving testers, developers, and business representatives in all feature discussions is known as the power of three.

Testers will work closely with both developers and business representatives to help them create suitable acceptance tests, working with developers to agree on the testing strategy, and deciding on test automation approaches. Testers can thus transfer and extend testing knowledge to other team members and influence the development of the product.
